# This Town Ain't Big Enough for the Both of Us!
## By Madison McQuillan

This game is a 2 player game where you try to eliminate the other player. You begin with a health of 10 and must hit the other player 10 times with your bullets before they hit you 10 times in order to win. The maximum number of bullets you can have on the screen is 5, meaning you can not spam the fire button. After one player wins, the screen will announce the results and then the game will reset. Have fun!

My game incorporates
* multiplayer: 2 player game, player on left side used WASD, player on right side uses arrows
* keyboard king: uses the control keys to fire the bullets
* sound blaster: there are sound effects when a bullet is fired and when a spaceship is hit by a bullet
* looking weak: at the top of the screen keeps the health level of both players
* points r us: tracks score which is the other players health (if one spaceships health is higher than the others then they have a higher score)
* shooter: shoot bullets to eliminate the other player
* textual: uses a dynamically generated text when health changes at the top of the screen
* fancy font: used a font found off the internet for the text
* the walls are hard: both players are constrained to their box on their respective sides of the screen
* muzak: have continuous music playing in the background 
* level up: the game increases in difficulty when someone loses health, they become faster
